/*/
This command was originally in the body of the index.html file, but according to the instructor, that is a beginners way to employ javascript.

Also, this line is supossed to be at the beginning of the index.js page, but it's too advanced for my knoweldge level.


document.getElementById("count-el").innerText = 5


/*/





/*/
Note: Cannot put console.log command above the variable, 
as javascript reads code from top to bottom

ex:

console.log(myAge)

let myAge = 0

result: Error cannot access 'myAge' before initialization


/*/


let myAge = 21

console.log(myAge)
