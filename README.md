# Learning-Javascript
Pretty much what the title implies, my progress into learning Javascript from scratch.  I would like to point out that I have very little previous coding experience, except for a crash course in HTML and CSS I took in 2020.


Found a 7 hour crash course on #javascript which i am determined to see through

Unfortunately the teacher didn't say which programs I had to download to write the code, and what I had to do exactly 'behind the scenes so to speak, so I ended up downloading Visual Studio Code.
