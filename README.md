# Learning-Javascript

#### Pretty much what the title implies, my progress into learning Javascript from scratch.  I would like to point out that I have very little previous coding experience, except for a crash course in HTML and CSS I took in 2020.


Found a 7 hour crash course on *javascript* which i am determined to see through

Unfortunately the teacher didn't say which programs I had to download to write the code, and what I had to do exactly 'behind the scenes' so to speak, so I ended up downloading Visual Studio Code.


*For future reference: Visual Studio Code : VSC*



Big Error:

I couldn't use the console to verify my little console.log command 





I tried downloading the Code Runner extension in VSC but it kept sending an error when I tried to run the code


```
let count = 0

console.log(count)

```


theoretically the answer should have just been 0, but I kept getting some weird node error message, so i tried using the generic chrome console. That one was annoying as hell, since I had to close and open a new tab everytime I wanted to check if my code was correct, so I tried to remove the error in VSC

I found this tutorial:

which was somehow useless to me since I had already done that, but I kept thinking about the node error.


It took me two hours to figure out the problem, but I downloaded nodejs and the npm library for ubuntu 20.04 using this link

That solved the problem :))))
